Bugs
----

If a user never logs in, someone else can grab their nickname

Issues
------

Close issues
Star issues (per user)
Archive issues (that's per user rather than per issue)
Possibly deprecate the upload form (and repositories) and do it all
   with upload.py?

Patch Sets
----------

Edit patch set message
Delete patch sets

Repositories and Branches
-------------------------

Edit/Delete Repository?
Automatically add Repository entries when a new project uploads stuff?

Searching, Organizing
---------------------

View all open issues by base, or by repository, or by user

Commenting
----------

Add stars
Add non-inline comments per file, per patchset, per issue
Support inline comments in patch (unified diff) view?

Mail
----

Add message-id for better gmail threading (if supported)
Add links to draft comments to Publish page
Use Django templates for mail bodies?

Diffs and Patches
-----------------

Improve UI for selecting patch set deltas; handle missing files better
Colorize unified diffs
Record revision and show in UI; indicate action (add/edit/delete)
Handle propsets?
Handle non-ASCII text
Handle binary files?!
Option to change threshold for suppressing long blocks of equal lines;
   and/or a JS UI to fetch the missing lines somehow
Add line length option
Support more diff formats (e.g. bzr; Thomas Wouters is working on this)
Need a more powerful way to specify the URL for finding a revision

User Experience
---------------

Make Edit/Delete Issue show the form inline instead of opening a new page?
Support more of the Mondrian functionality already in script.js, e.g. '?'
Prettify UI (ask John Skidgel for help?)
Fields "SVN Base" and "Base" have hard-to-guess names
Better UI for adding branches?  (Low priority now we have upload.py)

Software Engineering
--------------------

Unittests
Docstrings (module, class and file)

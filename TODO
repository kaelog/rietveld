Bugs
----

If a user never logs in, someone else can grab their nickname

Issues
------

Star issues (per user)
Archive issues (that's per user rather than per issue)

Patch Sets
----------

Edit patch set message
Delete patch sets

Repositories and Branches
-------------------------

Edit/Delete Repository?
Automatically add Repository entries when a new project uploads stuff?

Searching, Organizing
---------------------

View all open issues by base, or by repository, or by user
View all closed issues (issue 15 in the tracker)

Commenting
----------

Add stars
Add non-inline comments per file, per patchset, per issue
Support inline comments in patch (unified diff) view

Mail
----

Use Django templates for mail bodies?

Diffs and Patches
-----------------

Deprecate the upload form (and repositories) and do it all with upload.py
Improve UI for selecting patch set deltas; handle missing files better
Colorize unified diffs
Record revision and show in UI; indicate action (add/edit/delete)
Handle propsets?
Handle binary files?!
Add line length option
Support more diff formats
Need a more powerful way to specify the URL for finding a revision
Need to allow upload.py to upload the diff *and* the file

User Experience
---------------

Make Edit Issue show the form inline instead of opening a new page?
Support more of the Mondrian functionality already in script.js,
  e.g. j / k with arrow to select an issue
Prettify UI
Fields "SVN Base" and "Base" have hard-to-guess names
Better UI for adding branches?  (Low priority now we have upload.py)
